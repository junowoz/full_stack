//If we type 'tsc' in the console, it will output the errors!
//TypeScript help us finding bugs in our JavaScript code!

/**
 * TYPES
 * Type Inferences: the variable should remain the same type always
 * 
 * Type Shapes: TS knows what types our objects are. If we write toUppercAse
 *              it will know its wrong. We can check it with 'tsc' and then
 *              compile with: node name.js.
 * 
 * Any: It will not be an error if the variable we declare is of Any type.
 *      For example:    let any; in this case we can reassign without getting error.
