# Cloud Computing

Delivering computing services over the internet by a cloud provider. These services range from databases to networking to data storage.

- Storage
- Analytics
- Infrastructure

one bad thing is the proviver has access to your data and it's a cenralized system, meaning if anything happens to the provider, you lose your data. Sure, this is a rare case, but it's still something to consider.

## Carreers in Cloud Computing

Cloud should be accessed from local computers using command line tools or a web interface. Security is a vital aspect of using the cloud.

### Cloud Developer

The cloud developer uses cloud services to create desired business outcomes. They might develop functionality by integrating cloud services into an application. Cloud engineers are often going to be using programming languages. Common languages for working with cloud services include Python and Go.

### Cloud Administrator

The cloud administrator creates and manages the services that the business uses. The cloud developer will be connecting these services with their programs. The administrator focuses more on the configuration and maintenance of the cloud services.

### Cloud Architect

Cloud architects are responsible for the design and construction of cloud systems. The cloud architect determines the services used and how they connect. They are responsible for the high-level technical cloud strategy.

The cloud administrator will expand, configure, and maintain these systems. The cloud developer will use pieces of this cloud architecture to conduct their work.

## Cloud Specialties

### SecOps (Security Operations) / Cloud Security Engineer

The SecOps or cloud security engineer aims to prevent misuse of a companyâ€™s cloud infrastructure. This misuse can range from mistakes to malicious external users. Security engineers will often focus on controlling access to cloud services.

A SecOps engineer will require advanced knowledge of networking, data privacy, and security best practices. These tasks might involve defining roles for different teams, restricting permissions, and encryption. The security engineer protects data and defends the cloud system from external attacks.

### FinOps (Financial Operations) / Cloud Financial Engineer

The FinOps engineer or cloud financial engineer works on the finances of managing and running cloud services. A FinOps engineer will look for ways to improve cloud processes and service efficiency. They also might make extensive use of service logs to identify improvement opportunities. A FinOps engineer requires detailed knowledge of the prices of cloud offerings. These engineers will propose, test, and implement cost-effective changes.

### DevOps (Development Operations) / Site Reliability Engineer

The DevOps or Site Reliability engineer combines infrastructure and development work, emphasizing automation. This type of engineer seeks to find ways to improve processes for developing a system. DevOps engineers will need a deep knowledge of development processes and tooling. Tools used by a DevOps engineer can include Docker, Kubernetes, Git, and Jenkins. Some important aspects of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering work include:

**CI/CD Pipelines:** A series of steps to make changes to a project automatically built, tested, and deployed.
Monitoring: A practice enabling information to flow from our systems to our developers
Resiliency: A practice of making our systems able to continue to function even under problematic conditions.
We have only covered a few of the many specialties involving work in the cloud. As you develop your cloud skills, you will discover other aspects of the cloud ecosystem.
