# 2. TEMPLATES IN DJANGO

In order to create templates, they have to be stored in the application in a folder called templates/. Another folder needs to be created inside of this templates/ folder that uses the same name of the application. All of the templates will go into this folder named after the application. The full file path to a template should look like this:

projectname/
 |-- appname/
     |-- templates/
          |-- appname/
              |-- first_template.html
